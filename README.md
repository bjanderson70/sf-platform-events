Platform Event Wrapper - Work In Progress (WIP)
===============================================

See Document [PDF](https://github.com/bjanderson70/sf-platform-events/blob/master/PE-Framework.pdf)

What is it?
===========

This unmanaged package wraps the publish and subscribe mechanism in Salesforce.
It provides the ability change behavior at runtime, via Dependency Injection, as
well as changing behavior via extensions.

What is the value?
==================

Without some framework, or extensible tools, platform events are piecemealed,
forgotten, or a mish-mash of incongruous parts. It provides a consistent and
manageable control of publishing and subscribing to platform events; both
standard and high-volume events.

The value lies in being consistent, reliable, reusable and flexible.

How does it works?
==================

Defining a set of common interfaces and custom metadata within the Platform
Event framework allows one to change/augment aspects at different
levels/granularity. First, let’s define some of the salient components and their
functions before we walk through a code-snippet.

TBD: Use of Big Object for platform event repo

Salient Components
------------------

The Platform Event Wrapper provides six basic components:

| Component                   | Function                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| evt_IEventHandler           | Defines the behavior for a Publisher or Consumer                                                                               |
| evt_IPlatformEventModel     | Is a container for handling publish or subscription service                                                                    |
| evt_PlatformEvtBuilder      | Builds the model based on custom metadata, if defined, or uses defaults                                                        |
| evt_IProcessEventHandlers   | Container of handlers (log, success, error, alert)                                                                             |
| evt_PlatformEventAttrs      | Attributes used to manage logging (high-volume or standard), alerts, retries, validations, etc. of the publish/consume process |
| evt_PlatformEvtMdtDataModel | Provides a wrapper around the custom-metadata (DAO, Data Access Object), *evt_Platform_Event_Binding__mdt*                     |

A static class diagram brings this into more clarity.

Platform Event Model
--------------------

The Platform Event Model, *IPlatformEventModel*, defines the behavior for
processing platform events for publish or consumption.

Code Snippet / Example
----------------------

This code snippet, publishes an event, *pe_test__e*.

Steps 1 – 6 are described as follows (Step 1, is optional),

|   | Code                                                                                  | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 2 | **evt_PlatformEvtBuilder** builder = new evt_PlatformEvtBuilder(‘pe_test__e','test'); | Create a platform event builder. The event name, ‘*pe_test__e’,* along with the environment, ‘test’, is looked up in the custom metadata. The custom metadata may contain, four handlers.

| 3 | **evt_IEventHandler** publisher = builder.buildPublisher();                           | From step 2, the builder knows if there are any special handlers (other than the default) defined in the custom metadata. Publisher follow the process log, check, alert and publish.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4 | **evt_IPlatformEventModel** model = builder.build(publisher);                         | From step 2, we can build the model. The model holds the four handlers, the event handler (publisher) and attributes that control the behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Custom Metadata
===============

In the custom metadata type below (**Apex Code Configurations),** three
environments (based on the ‘*Label’*) are defined with three different runtime
environments.

1.  **[DEBUG]** *a Sandbox (not running in a Unit Test)*

2.  **[PROD]** *Not a sandbox and not a Test procedure*

3.  **[TEST]** *i.e. Test.IsRunning*

Platform Attributes
===================

Platform attributes class, *evt_PlatformEventAttrs*, helps control functionality
of the process of publishing and subscription. The table below breaks down the
attributes and purpose. The names are defined in the class,
*PlatformEventAttrs.cls,* and shown bellows.

| RETRY_COUNT_s         | **Integer**, the value between 1 and 9 (inclusive), default is 5 | Number of retries; the default is 5. Retries occur ONLY for subscribers.

Custom Metadata
===============

The Platform Event Wrapper uses a custom metadata,
*evt_Platform_Event_Binding__mdt*, to lookup the event information. The
information contains the following fields:

| Label           | API Name           | Type                             | Comment                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Active          | Active__c          | Checkbox                         | Allow execution. If inactive the event is not handled (published or consumed)                                                                                          |
| Alert Handler   | Alert_Handler__c   | Text(255)                        | The alert handler will be called at various steps performed by the consumer or the publisher                                                                           |
| Consumer        | Consumer__c        | String                           | The consumer is how one decides to consume an event. There are hooks to override behavior, as needed.                                                                  |
| Environment     | Environment__c     | Picklist (test,debug,production) | Which environment this event will run in                                                                                                                               |
| Error Handler   | Error_Handler__c   | String                           | The error handler will be called at various steps of errors/exception that occur in the consumer or the publisher                                                      |
| High Volume     | High_Volume__c     | Boolean                          | Is this a high-volume? If true, then it is common to save the incoming event in JSON and passed to the log handler                                                     |
| Log Handler     | Log_Handler__c     | String                           | The log handler will be called in the consumer or the publisher with instrumentation data                                                                              |
| Pulisher        | Pulisher__c        | String                           | The publisher to invoke. The default publisher, evt_DefaultPEPublisher, provides a consistent process for publishing. There are hooks to override behavior, if needed. |
